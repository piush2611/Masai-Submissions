                        <h3>Early years</h3>
                        <p>Torvalds was born in <a href="">Helsinki, Finland</a>, on December 28, 1969. He is the son of journalists Anna and <a href="">Nils Torvalds</a>, and the grandson of statistician <a href="">Leo Törnqvist</a> and of poet <a href="">Ole Torvalds</a>. Both of his parents were campus radicals at the <a href="">University of Helsinki</a> in the 1960s. His family belongs to the <a href="">Swedish-speaking minority</a>. Torvalds was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize-winning American chemist, although in the book <i>Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution</i>, Torvalds is quoted as saying, "I think I was named equally for <a href="">Linus</a> the <a href="">Peanuts</a> cartoon character", noting that this makes him half "Nobel Prize-winning chemist" and half "blanket-carrying cartoon character</p>
                        <p>Torvalds attended the <a href="">University of Helsinki</a> between 1988 and 1996,[12] graduating with a master's degree in <a href="">computer science</a> from the NODES research group.[13] His academic career was interrupted after his first year of study when he joined the <a href="">Finnish Army Uusimaa</a> brigade, in the summer of 1989, selecting the 11-month officer training program to fulfill the <a href="">mandatory military service of Finland</a>I the army he held the rank of <a href="">Second Lieutenant</a>, with the role of a ballistic calculation officer.[14] Torvalds bought computer science professor <a href="">Andrew Tanenbaum's</a> book <a href=""><i>Operating Systems: Design and Implementation</i></a>, in which Tanenbaum describes <a href="">MINIX</a>, an educational stripped-down version of <a href="">Unix</a>. In 1990, he resumed his university studies, and was exposed to UNIX for the first time, in the form of a <a href="">DEC MicroVAX </a> running <a href="">ULTRIX</a>.[15] His MSc thesis was titled <a href="">Linux</a>: A Portable Operating System</p>

                <p>His interest in computers began with a <a href="">Commodore VIC-20</a>,[17] at the age of 11 in 1981, initially programming in <a href="">BASIC</a>, but later by directly accessing the <a href="">6502</a> CPU in <a href="">machine code</a>. He did not make use of <a href="">assembly language</a>.[18] After the VIC-20 he purchased a <a href="">Sinclair QL</a>, which he modified extensively, especially its operating system. "Because it was so hard to get software for it in Finland, Linus wrote his own assembler and <a href="">editor</a> (in addition to <a href="">Pac-Man</a> graphics libraries)"[19] for the QL, as well as a few games.[20][21] He wrote a <i><a href="">Pac-Man</a></i> clone named Cool Man. On January 5, 1991[22] he purchased an Intel 80386-based clone of IBM PC[23] before receiving his MINIX copy, which in turn enabled him to begin work on Linux. </p>
                <h3>Linux</h3>
                <p>The first prototypes of Linux were publicly released later that year (1991).[11][24] Version 1.0 was released on March 14, 1994</p>
                <p>Torvalds first encountered the <a href="">GNU Project</a> in 1991, after another Swedish-speaking computer science student, Lars Wirzenius, took him to the University of Technology to listen to free software guru <a href="">Richard Stallman's</a> speech. Torvalds used Stallman's <a href="">GNU General Public License</a> version 2 (GPLv2) for his <a href="">Linux kernel</a>.</p>
                <p>After a visit to <a href="">Transmeta</a> in late 1996,[4] Torvalds accepted a position at the company in California, where he would work from February 1997 until June 2003. He then moved to the <a href="">Open Source Development Labs</a>, which has since merged with the <a href="">Free Standards Group</a> to become the <a href="">Linux Foundation</a>, under whose auspices he continues to work. In June 2004, Torvalds and his family moved to <a href="">Dunthorpe, Oregon</a>,[1] to be closer to the OSDL's Beaverton, Oregon-based headquarters.</p>
